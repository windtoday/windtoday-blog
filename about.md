## Windtoday.co, the intelligent Windsurfing marketpalce.

Our mission is to improve the e-commerce ecosystem of windsurfing, whether new or used equipment.

For do this, we promote the best offers from our different suppliers, following a shared market model and open data.

Using this approach, the user has important control of what to buy and where. Over time, the price of gear tends to fall and demands will be higher.

We are integrated with leading international providers, and we offer you all the ads in one place, our website, where you can perform a simple or complex search to find what you are looking for.
