We are very excited to announce the new version of [windtoday.co](https://windtoday.co). We called it **version 3.0.0** ðŸŽ‰.

This new version is focused on improving the mobile experience, optimizing all the application menus to be accessible with one hand.

Letâ€™s walk through whatâ€™s been improved and whatâ€™s altogether new!

## Mobile First

</figure>

From the first version of the application we learned that people access it mainly from mobile devices, so we decided to redesign the website to be more mobile-friendly so that it can be used with only one hand.

This includes a new design. Of course you can still visit the website from your computer, but now the mobile experience is better.

## Sorting products

In the application, the products are showed following a certain order.

The sorting method that we use to show products is based on a price score analyzing each product in the market, comparing them with similar products.

This makes possible showing at the top better deals based not only in the price, but also in the year, condition, material and size.

We recommend you to read [How Catch Best Offers](https://blog.windtoday.co/how-catch-best-offers) to learn more about that.

The new feature that we included now is the possibility to change the sort criteria.

For example, if you are interested in checking the latest products added in the marketplace, now you can.

This opens a whole new world of possibilities, like sorting results by year or price. We are exploring more useful criteria to be added in the future. Stay tuned for further news.

## Filtering the search

Our mission is to provide all the information to you so that you can choose the right product. This includes letting you choose among lots of filters to apply in the current search. e.g: price, year, brands, size, material.

Since we have so many filters, it's difficult to show you the information altogether. Actually, we don't to do it. We have simplified the process designing a better way to apply filters that we call tagging filtering.

Now, each product in the market has a set of tags related to the product: year, condition, range of size, material. Simply clicking on them will filter across the marketplace just to see products with the selected tags.

You can apply different tag filters at the same time and refine the search easily. This makes the process more friendly, showing less unnecessary information.

## Showing technical information

We were lacking this feature in previous versions of [windtoday.co](https://windtoday.co). But not anymore! It has just been added.

When you click in an product, instead of going directly to the shop, now you will see more technical information related to the product.

This new behavior eases the process of going back to check for similar products without losing the focus of the search.

It also makes sharing the URL easier.
