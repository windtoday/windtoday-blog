More closest criteria will return less and more closest results.

## Refine the results

After search something, maybe you are interested in get a more specific results.

For example, based on a range of price. Or just you want new items. Or both.

Apply the filters that you can see in the lateral menus.

- Left filters are more generic (price, year, condition, category...)
- Right filters are more specific a closest with each category (% of carbon, material of construction, size range...).
