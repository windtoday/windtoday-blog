## Phrase Search

The search is designed for provide you as results as possible based in the input criteria.

Also, the search engine is smart:

- No matters if you write in lowercase or uppercase, search is insensitive.
- No matters if you don't write the right query, search is typo tolerance.

This means, even if you don't sure about the right name for a brand or model, the search engine try to resolve the query gracefully.

On the other hand, if you want to perform a exact search, disabling this default behavior, just the thing you have to do is enter the query using `""`, like `"NeilPryde Combat"`.

## Negate Search

Maybe you are interested in exclude a particular set of results.

That's useful when you are looking for good prices closest to a brand, but you wnat to exclude a set of models (for example, you are interested in slalom models and you want to exclude wave or freestyle models)

You can use the `-` symbol for this action, in this case, `NeilPryde -combat`.

## Search in a search

The aside filters make possible refine the current search, but also provide you extra information: It shows you the distribution of the data, and you can get a more high level vision about what brands are more present in the market.

One consideration here is that the component have a search inside. In the screenshot you see a total of 10 brands, but this doesn't means that in the search alive more than 200 brands: The brands filter is showing you just the Top10 more present brands.

You can use the internal search (or expand the component) for see the rest.
