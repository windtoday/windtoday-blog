## We do more that you thing

This computational step is necessary for be possible lately use the search and apply filters, query on real time and the rest of stuff.

This is no different than how Google works. All time you read about SEO for Google, Yahoo or Bing, you are reading exactly the same thing: How to make easy for the process read the data.

## The one line title

Because we are integrated with shops around the world, we detected pattern that are more effective and make easy make a good integration.

The point is reduce all the minimal information related with the item in one line. A good pattern for that is:

```
{BRAND} {MODEL} {SPEC} {YEAR} - {COMMENT}
```

As you can see:

- It reduces all the minimal information in one line.
- The information follow a determinate structure.
- The structure is predictable.

## Always use units

Even if you are defining the title for a sail size or a mast carbon, always use the right unit.

* Sails Size: Goya Eclipse **3.7m** 2011 - 90€
* Board Size: Fanatic Viper Soft Deck **91L** 2016 - 941€
* Mast Carbon: NeilPryde X35 **C35** SDM 2015 - 164€
* Mast Size: SDM NeilPryde X3 **400cm** - 150€
 
It makes the information complete.

## Same item, different size

If you want to offer the same item in different sizes, the best way is by varying only this size value

## Second hand section per each category

It's a good approach that shops offers second hand stock as well. We love it!
